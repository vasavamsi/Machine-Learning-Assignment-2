>>> After implementing the Gradient descent through SGD method following are the results using non_vectorized method

>> For the dataset given in the question with batch_size = 1 and 100 iterations
> with fit_intercept = True
RMSE = 14.13
MAE = 11.2

> with fit_intercept = False
RMSE = 12.90
MAE = 10.22

>> For the dataset given in the question with batch_size = 15 and 100 iterations
> with fit_intercept = True
RMSE = 6.50
MAE = 4.87

> with fit_intercept = False
RMSE = 6.40
MAE = 4.68
